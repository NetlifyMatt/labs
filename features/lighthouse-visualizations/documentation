If you have the Lighthouse Build Plugin installed, you can now view the Lighthouse scores for your builds on your site's Deploy page by enabling the Lighthouse Visualizations feature under Labs.

If you have multiple audits (directories, paths, etc) defined in your build, we will display a roll-up of the average Lighthouse scores for all the current build's audits plus the results for each individual audit.

Some items of note:
- The Lighthouse Build Plugin must be installed on your site(s) in order for these score visualizations to be displayed.
- This Labs feature is currently only enabled at the user-level, so it will need to be enabled for each individual team member that wishes to see the Lighthouse scores displayed.

We have a lot planned for this feature and will be adding functionality regularly, but we'd also love to hear your thoughts. Please click the "Give feedback" link under the Lighthouse scores to tell us what you think.
