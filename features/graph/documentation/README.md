## Overview

Netlify Graph enables developers to seamlessly integrate third-party APIs and services into their web applications without writing API-specific code. Instead of connecting different APIs and SDKs with brittle code, you can now abstract all that behind a convenient GraphQL interface.

Essentially, Netlify handles the messy integration work so you can focus on solving other problems.

### Components

Netlify Graph has three core components. You can learn more about each by reading their documentation pages:

- [API Management](api-management.md)
- [API Explorer](api-explorer.md)
- [API Authentication](api-authentication.md)
